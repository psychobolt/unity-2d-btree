# Unity BTree

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/psychobolt/unity-btree.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/psychobolt/unity-btree)

Behavior tree framework for creating AI behaviors in Unity with Reactive Extensions support. See [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx) for more details.

An AI Behaviour Tree is a state machine and data structure that controls and manages the state of the AI in a tree hiearchy. To understand how behavior trees work, please see Gamasutra's [article](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ChrisSimpson/20140717/221339/Behavior_trees_for_AI_How_they_work.php).

> NOTE: Please be advised, currently BTree is a project that does not have a stable release cycle. So use with caution, it is highly experimental.
